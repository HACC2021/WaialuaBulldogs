  <abstract>***FOR INTERNAL AND OFFICIAL USE ONLY*** 
***NOT FOR PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION***
DUE TO MANY SENSITVE HISTORICAL TRAILS, TRAILS THAT CROSS OVER PRIVATE LANDS, AND TRAILS THAT ARE UNMAINTAINED AND/OR HAZARDOUS, DO NOT DISTRIBUTE TO THE PUBLIC.
Inventory of known trails (identifiable linear course), and trail access (easement or way for general public) systems throughout the State of Hawaii.
This dataset is a graphical representation of trails and access locations. It may not overlay well on various satellite imagery datasets at certain scales. Another thing to note, historical trails digitized from paper maps, may be difficult to relocate.
DO NOT wander off marked trails as it may be hazardous.
Authority: Hawai‘i Revised Statutes, Chapter 198D and Hawai‘i Administrative Rules, Title 13, Chapter 130. 
Na Ala Hele Program Trails may be "Closed", taken out of "Program Trail" status temporarily or permanent due to safety, maintenance, funding issues, etc.

***FOR INTERNAL AND OFFICIAL USE ONLY*** ***NOT FOR PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION*** Trails and access systems were compiled and digitized by DLNR/DOFAW from various sources, 1998-2000. This layer is updated on an as needed basis, and historic trail research is still ongoing. Updates 2002, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017. Latest update October 2018.
