Regrets on the mess in our code repository, but i have been posting anything that was an advancement in our capabilities.  

Here are two best examples of code:

plot_oahu.r
  package sf: https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/

  make_leaflet_map.r
    package leaflet:  https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/

#-----  KML DATA ESSENTIAL to our project:
#-----  kml sources
OAHU TRAIL

OAHU COASTLINE

OAHU RESERVES
https://opendata.arcgis.com/api/v3/datasets/6c4ad137c0e54d398712fd2e3e68e50e_1/downloads/data?format=kml&spatialRefId=4326

#-----  we made 'home-brewed' kml, docs sourced in R code are in our repository:
  trails_kml.kml
  Coastline.kml
  bd_kml_good.kml

#-----  this was useful for finding lattitude and longitude to be hard-coded (where are the coordinates of Hawaii/Oahu?):

#-----  R is a great opensource project 
https://www.r-project.org/
#-----   r-spatial is our workhorse!
